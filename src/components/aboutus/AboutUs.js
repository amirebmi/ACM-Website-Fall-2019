							<h1>Who are we?</h1>
							<p>We are a chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA). We are CSULA's largest computer
            science student organization. We bring together students with common passions and devotions into the field of computing. </p>
							<p>ACM is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, delivering resources that advance computing as a science and a profession.
							  ACM provides the computing field's premier Digital Library and serves its members and the computing profession with leading-edge publications,
            conferences, and career resources.</p>

							<h1>What do we offer?</h1>
							<p>We provide professional development workshops, Mini-Hackathons, and tech tours. We also invite guest speakers from Google, Lockheed Martin, JPL, and other companies. </p>
							<p>We have excellent leadership opportunities and tutoring for students. We have social events, including hiking, game night, movie night, for students
            to network with each other and destress from classes. </p>
							<p>We know that learning takes more than just attending classes, so we have project workshops for students to gain hands-on experience</p>
